                <p class="grid-item-1">We believe that cats are awesome because they are independent spirits; playful, fun-loving creatures; and, best of all, they are intelligent and empathetic. A dog may want you to be there all of the time but a cat will love you even if you don't spend 24/7 with it and that suits some people a lot more. Cats are quiet, pensive souls who will please themselves.</p>

                    <h1>Caring For Cats Is Easy!</h1>
                    <p>The main things that cats need are: food, warmth and love!<br>
                            <br>
                            Of course, there's more to it than just that. They also need routine, respect and somewhere to poop! If you don't want your cat to do its business in your garden, you'll need to provide it with a litter tray which will need cleaning daily. That means scooping out the mess and replacing the litter tray gravel.<br> 
                            <br>
                            You'll also need to make sure your cat is getting plenty of water (they like milk but don't necessarily need it as they get calcium from their food). Cats will also eat more or less anything (within reason!) and will undoubtedly be interested in what you're having!! However, it is not wise to always feed them human food as this can often be too rich for their delicate bellies so it is advisable to feed them special cat food. There are lots of different types ranging from recipes aimed at kittens, right through to senior cats. Remember: your cat will have different needs throughout its life. You can also buy treats which are often designed to aid teeth cleaning or other health aspects.<br>
                            <br>
                            Whilst lots of cats like to be indoors most of the time, they will need access to outside space to ensure that they are given a chance to burn off all that energy they have - especially when they're younger! If you live near a busy road, it might be wise to consider how you will keep your cat safe from cars. Plenty of products exist now to ensure you can manage this effectively.

                <h1>Where can you get a cat?</h1>
                <p>
                    There are LOADS of places to get cats from. <br>
                    <br>
                    Whilst you can buy a cat from a breeder (many of whom can be sought out online), you may find that this can lead to difficulties later on if the breeder was not familiar with the needs of a new born kitten, or if the little guy or gal is taken away from its mum too soon.<br>
                    <br>
                    A more popular choice is to get a cat from a local rescue centre - many of whom are full of animals who desperately need re-homing. A lot of people assume that you won't be able to get a kitten from a rescue centre but this simply isn't true; there are lots of kittens looking for their new home! <br>
                    <br>
                    Often, rescue centres will want to assess your suitability for owning a pet too. This can involve a home visit which will look at your house, its position (roads, garden, house/flat), whether you have other animals at home etc. and sometimes an interview too to assess how serious you are. Having a cat (or any pet!) is a big commitment which can go on for up to 20 years - don't go into this without giving it serious thought!!
